grass.run_command('g.remove', type='raster', name=name, flags ='f')

# Export

# If the raster is float, export as type=Float32 instead of float64; If it is integer, export as Int16 instead of Int32. This procedure reduces the number of decimal numbers or the information for each pixel, reducing file size.
# For several applications you can use r.mapcalc to transform the pixel value in an integer, e.g., if it goes from 0 to 1, multiply by 100 turning it to integer, reducing the map size also.
# But if your raster is binary, just compress 
# grass.run_command('r.out.gdal', createopt="TFW=YES,COMPRESS=DEFLATE")
